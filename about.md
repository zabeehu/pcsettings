## About PCSettings.net

[comment]: <span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

PCSettings.net was originally created to offer guides to build the best gaming PC. There are many tutorials available online, however we wanted to offer the very easy guides to follow since its hard for a lot of people to decide. It's easy to go overboard and people don't always realize the power of affordable components. A respectable gaming PC can be built for under $500. We offer guides in most price ranges, and hope that we help anyone who is undecided.

We also research and find cool PC setups for all purposes, not just gaming. We love cool tech companies and products, and want to share the best of the best. This includes finding professional gamers and sharing what they use. There are many great options and it is fun to see what the best are using to be successful.
